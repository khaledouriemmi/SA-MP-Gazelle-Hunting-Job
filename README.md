# Gazelle Hunting Job for SA-MP

This is a **Gazelle Hunting Job** plugin for your SA-MP game mode. It allows players with the Hunter job to hunt gazelles, butcher them, collect meat, and sell it for profit.

## üìã Features

- Spawns 24 gazelle objects at predefined locations on map.
- Allows players to start the Hunter job and receive a vehicle & weapon.
- Enables hunting behavior: shoot gazelles, butcher with `Y`, then ` /grab` meat.
- Limits carry to 5 gazelles per trip; sell at the trapper NPC for randomized pay.
- Auto-respawns gazelles after a set timer or upon quitting the job.
- Handles player disconnects: auto-pays for collected meat.
- Configurable job commands: `/findjob HUNTER`, `/grab`, `/quitjob`.
- Fully commented functions for easy editing, replacement, or extension.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Copy the plugin code into your server gamemode script (`.pwn` file).
2. Define the following at the top of your script:
   ```pawn
   #define GAZELLE_MODEL_ID 19315
   // Arrays and enums for gazelle job...
   ```
3. In your `OnGameModeInit`, add the initialization block under the comment `// look for stock`:
   ```pawn
   onGameModeInit()
   {
       // Gazelle job init...
   }
   ```
4. Hook into `OnPlayerConnect`, `OnPlayerDisconnect`, `OnPlayerPickUpDynamicPickup`, `OnPlayerWeaponShot`, `OnPlayerUpdate`, `OnPlayerKeyStateChange`, and add the provided forward declarations.
5. Add the new job type in your `enum JobType` list:
   ```pawn
   enum { JOB_NONE = -1, /* ... */ JOB_HUNTER };
   ```
6. Extend your `/jobhelp` and GPS locator to include the Hunter job.
